# my-chest

## what is this
just a playground for anything about *react* i can come up with and have interest in

## what do we get
nearly nothing ...
- *WIP*  tik-tak-toe
  a simple game from react's doc
  anything different ?
  - rewriten with functional components
  - might add some other feature

- *WIP*  gobang
  maybe it's not proper to call it a WIP project
  i have not really started it yet

## what will we get
maybe a tiny website with some tiny project(games and some tools etc.)
but never looking forward to it
after all, it is just a playground for myself to learn and practice
